    <h1>Inside the SharePoint Storm: Active Exploitation of CVE-2025-53770 and How to Defend</h1>
    <p>Organizations running on‑premises Microsoft SharePoint are facing active, mass exploitation of a newly disclosed zero‑day, CVE‑2025‑53770. Adversaries are rapidly iterating TTPs—rolling out fresh webshell families, shifting post‑exploitation tradecraft, and moving from data theft to ransomware deployment. This post consolidates what’s known, unpacks the technical mechanics, and offers concrete detection and response guidance for security engineers and administrators.</p>
    <h2>Background</h2>
    <p>In late July 2025, multiple security vendors and incident response teams reported in‑the‑wild exploitation of a SharePoint zero‑day tracked as CVE‑2025‑53770. Impacted products include supported on‑premises SharePoint Server versions with vulnerable application pages and API endpoints exposed to untrusted users. Initial reporting points to financially motivated groups and China‑nexus operators abusing internet‑exposed SharePoint frontends for initial access, followed by rapid persistence via webshells and lateral movement into domain controllers. Microsoft subsequently assigned a CVE and released mitigations and updates on an accelerated timeline. Over the following days, defenders observed evolving exploit variants and payloads, including new webshell dropper patterns, living‑off‑the‑land (LotL) binary abuse, and hands‑on‑keyboard staging for ransomware.</p>
    <h2>Technical Analysis</h2>
    <p>CVE‑2025‑53770 appears to be an authentication bypass leading to remote code execution (RCE) in SharePoint’s front‑end request pipeline. The exploitation chain observed in the wild typically follows this pattern: (1) External unauthenticated HTTP POST to a vulnerable application endpoint (commonly under /_api/ or /_layouts/ paths) using crafted headers to manipulate claims or bypass authorization checks; (2) Server‑side deserialization or gadget invocation via user‑supplied parameters triggers arbitrary command execution under the SharePoint application pool identity; (3) Webshell deployment to writable paths (e.g., Program Files\Common Files\microsoft shared\Web Server Extensions\16\TEMPLATE\LAYOUTS\ or site‑specific _layouts directories) with randomized filenames and minimal signatures; (4) Immediate beaconing to C2 or interactive command execution, followed by credential dumping and lateral movement.<br><br>Vulnerability class: authN/authZ bypass leading to code execution, likely via unsafe input flowing into a deserialization or dynamic compilation path. Indicators include anomalous usage of X‑Forwarded‑For and X‑ClientService‑ClientTag headers, unusual SharePointClientService requests, and request bodies containing serialized .NET payloads or Base64‑encoded stagers.<br><br>Observed webshell families: (a) Minimal ASPX stagers that proxy commands to powershell.exe with Base64‑encoded arguments; (b) Password‑gated China Chopper‑style handlers with compact POST parameters (e.g., z, p); (c) Obfuscated JScript‑embedded ASPX webshells that fetch second‑stage payloads from attacker‑controlled CDNs. Several samples embed unique markers such as comment tags <!-- spx:ok --> or hardcoded keys derived from MachineKey‑style strings.<br><br>Post‑exploitation: Attackers commonly (1) enumerate SharePoint farm topology (Get‑SPFarm) and service accounts, (2) dump LSASS via comsvcs.dll MiniDump or leverage rundll32 with sspi providers, (3) use Certutil, Curl, or PowerShell WebClient to retrieve tools, (4) pivot with SMB over NTLM or Kerberos, (5) deploy scheduled tasks or WMI subscriptions for persistence, and (6) stage ransomware using PsExec or Impacket’s smbexec against servers with shared storage. Data theft precedes encryption in many cases—targeting document libraries and mapped file shares.<br><br>Sample HTTP trace (sanitized): POST /_layouts/15/AppManagement.aspx HTTP/1.1; Headers: Content‑Type: application/xml; X‑Forwarded‑For: spoofed; Body: serialized .NET blob containing a gadget chain invoking System.Diagnostics.Process.Start with powershell -enc ... Webserver logs show immediate creation of .aspx files under LAYOUTS with high‑entropy names (e.g., /_layouts/15/aspnet_client/a1e9b.aspx).<br><br>Host artifacts: Unexpected files in LAYOUTS and TEMPLATE directories, modified web.config entries enabling script execution, recent writes by w3wp.exe, and PowerShell Operational logs (Event ID 4104) with frombase64string invocations. SharePoint ULS logs record correlation IDs tied to failed claims validation followed by successful page rendering on nonstandard endpoints.</p>
    <h2>Impact & Implications</h2>
    <p>Any internet‑exposed SharePoint Server without the mitigations or patches is at high risk of compromise with minimal attacker effort. Because SharePoint often holds sensitive documents and connects to internal authentication and workflow systems, a single foothold can cascade to full domain compromise and fleet‑wide ransomware. Managed service providers hosting multi‑tenant SharePoint farms face elevated blast radius if segmentation and per‑tenant isolation are weak. Even internal‑only deployments are at risk from phishing‑borne VPN access or compromised jump hosts. The rapid evolution of exploit variants suggests we will see commodity crimeware adoption, automated scanning, and wormable‑like propagation across poorly segmented enterprise networks. Expect long‑tail exploitation against unpatched systems months after patches are released.</p>
    <h2>Defensive Recommendations</h2>
    <p>Immediate actions<br>1) Patch and mitigate: Apply Microsoft’s security update for CVE‑2025‑53770 across all SharePoint servers. If patching is delayed, implement vendor‑provided mitigations (e.g., request filtering rules, disabling vulnerable endpoints) and place SharePoint behind an authenticated reverse proxy.<br>2) Reduce exposure: Do not expose SharePoint admin and application pages directly to the internet. Restrict access with IP allowlists, conditional access, or VPN. Enforce MFA for all SharePoint administrators and privileged service accounts.<br>3) Detection engineering: Add HTTP request analytics for anomalies on /_api/ and /_layouts/ paths, high 200/302 rates from single IPs, unusual headers (X‑ClientService‑ClientTag, X‑Forwarded‑For mismatches), and large POSTs with Base64 chunks. Hunt for webshell drops: new .aspx files in LAYOUTS/TEMPLATE folders, recent writes by w3wp.exe, and unexpected web.config modifications. Monitor for PowerShell 4104 with frombase64string, Invoke‑Expression, or downloads via System.Net.WebClient.<br>4) IOC and behavior hunts: Files containing <!-- spx:ok --> or short POST parameters (z, p) to new .aspx endpoints; outbound traffic to uncommon VPS ASNs; creation of Scheduled Tasks or WMI subscriptions shortly after SharePoint worker activity; LSASS access events (Sysmon Event ID 10).<br>5) Hardening: Ensure SharePoint runs with least‑privileged service accounts; disable legacy authentication; rotate application pool and farm account credentials post‑incident; enable Antimalware Scan Interface (AMSI) and Defender for Endpoint with real‑time scanning; block outbound egress from SharePoint to the internet except required destinations.<br>6) Network controls: Place SharePoint in a segmented DMZ, restrict lateral movement with host firewalls, enforce SMB signing, and monitor NTLM usage. Consider an application firewall rule set to block suspicious serialized payloads and deny execution of .aspx uploads in content directories.<br>Incident response playbook<br>• Contain: Remove internet exposure, isolate the affected server(s), snapshot memory, and preserve ULS/IIS logs. Disable compromised service accounts and revoke tokens.<br>• Eradicate: Enumerate and remove webshells, backdoors, scheduled tasks, WMI event consumers, and modified web.config entries. Validate integrity of LAYOUTS/TEMPLATE trees against known‑good baselines.<br>• Recover: Rebuild from gold images where feasible, rotate all secrets accessed by the SharePoint server, and re‑join to domain with fresh credentials. Apply patches before re‑exposure.<br>• Post‑incident: Implement continuous monitoring for the above behaviors, tune detections for serialized payloads, and conduct tabletop exercises for SharePoint‑centric ransomware scenarios.<br>Sample detections (pseudocode)<br>• Webshell write: where Image=w3wp.exe and EventType=FileCreate and TargetPath endswith .aspx and TargetPath contains \TEMPLATE\LAYOUTS\<br>• Suspicious PS: EventID=4104 and ScriptBlockText contains frombase64string and (Invoke‑Expression or IEX)<br>• HTTP anomaly: status=200 and cs-uri-stem startswith /_layouts/ and sc-bytes&lt;500 and cs-method=POST and request-body matches base64 pattern length&gt;=1KB</p>
    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>CVE‑2025‑53770 underscores a recurring theme: internet‑exposed collaboration platforms are prime initial‑access targets, and attackers adapt faster than patch cycles. Prioritize patching, minimize exposure, and invest in behavior‑based detections focused on SharePoint’s unique file paths and process patterns. Treat any unpatched SharePoint system as at‑risk, assume webshell attempts are ongoing, and be prepared for lateral movement and ransomware within hours of initial compromise.</p>
