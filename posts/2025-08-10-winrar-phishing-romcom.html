    <h1>Phishing attacks exploit WinRAR flaw CVE-2025-8088 to install RomCom</h1>
    <p>On August 2, 2025, a now-patched flaw in a ubiquitous file‑compression tool was turned into a weaponized phishing layer. ESET’s latest research links the CVE‑2025‑8088 directory traversal bug in WinRAR to a campaign that dropped the RomCom RAT onto targeted Windows systems. The attackers leveraged the flaw to write files anywhere on the victim’s machine whenever the user logged in, enabling persistent, undetected persistence and remote command execution.
    </p>
    <h2>Background</h2>
    <p>The vulnerability, fixed in WinRAR version 7.13, was compromised by Russian‑GRU‑aligned threat actor UNC4210. The campaign employed spear‑phishing emails with pro‑Ukrainian lures targeting military personnel and others involved in providing assistance to Ukraine. The emails contained a malicious RAR attachment that, once opened, exploited CVE‑2025‑8088 and installed the RomCom backdoor, which collects system information, executes arbitrary commands, and exfiltrates files.</p>
    <h2>Technical Analysis</h2>
    <p>CV E‑2025‑8088 is a classic directory traversal flaw that allows write access outside the intended extraction directory. Attackers craft a RAR archive that, when processed by WinRAR, writes a malicious executable to an arbitrary path. In this campaign the file was dropped into the Windows <code>AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Startup</code> folder, ensuring execution on every user login. The RomCom RAT was deployed via a .exe that registers as a background service, enabling stealthy data exfiltration and remote control. ESET’s PoC confirmed that the exploit works against any WinRAR build older than 7.13 and that the backdoor can be triggered immediately after the target opens the malicious attachment.
    </p>
    <h2>Impact & Implications</h2>
    <p>While the campaign focused on Ukrainian military and support personnel, the technique is broadly applicable. Any organization using WinRAR or consuming RAR files from external sources is at risk if users are not up‑to‑date. The use of a common utility lowers the attack surface, bypasses many traditional AV heuristics, and exploits legitimate user behavior (opening an archive). The clandestine reuse of phishing campaigns alongside the zero‑day gives adversaries a potent blend of social engineering and software exploitation.
    </p>
    <h2>Defensive Recommendations</h2>
    <p>
        1. Update WinRAR to version 7.13 or later as soon as possible; the patch removes the directory traversal vector.
        <br>2. Disable the automatic execution of unknown archives in email clients and sandbox RAR files before opening.
        <br>3. Deploy context‑aware data‑loss prevention (DLP) to block rare file extensions or files extracted to system folders.
        <br>4. Monitor for anomalous writes to the Startup folder and the creation of new locally signed executables.
        <br>5. Enforce least privilege for local user accounts to minimize the impact of an elevated RAR exploit.
    </p>
    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>This incident underscores the importance of patching even “low‑profile” utilities and the need for layered defenses that combine technical controls with user‑training. While WinRAR’s flaw is now fixed, the pattern of using ubiquitous software as a delivery mechanism for sophisticated malware is likely to persist. Security teams should treat modern archive utilities as potential attack vectors and ensure continuous monitoring, rapid patch deployment, and multi‑factor authentication for privileged accounts.
